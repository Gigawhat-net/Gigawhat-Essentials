### Disclaimer: Mod is in early development.
#### Note: I am currently working on the <a href="https://www.gigawhat.net">Gigawhat website</a>; Development Gigawhat Essentials will begin soon.
***Note 2:** Before installing any version of the mod, be sure to check <a href="https://github.com/Gigawhat-net/Gigawhat-Essentials/blob/dev/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a>*

<br>
Gigawhat Essentials is based on the EssentialsX plugin suite: https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials
<br>
<br>
This mod is made for people that want to run Forge mods and EssentialsX at the same time.<br>
Usually, to do this you would use <a href="https://github.com/MohistMC">Mohist</a> or <a href="https://github.com/magmafoundation">Magma</a> but because the Forge API and the Bukkit API were not designed to run together, major issues and or bugs could occur.<br>
We also have plans to add features from some popular plugins to the mod. Of course, they would be optional and fully customizable.<br>
<br>

## Features :

### Features :
   
   - *Currently none. The mod is still in early development.*


### Planned Features :
   
   - ***Almost all of EssetnialX's commands and features.** (This includes all official EssentialsX add-ons)*
   - ***Highly advanced and customizable permission system.***
   - ***Features from some popular plugins.** (Low priority)*
